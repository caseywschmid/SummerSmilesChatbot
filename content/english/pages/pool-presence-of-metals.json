      "text": "Corrosion of pipes, pumps and other pool components is all part of the natural life cycle of your installation, but can over time contribute to the presence of dissolved metals in the water. Iron, copper and manganese are the most commonly found metals. Their presence in the water becomes problematic when they colour the water, adhere to or stain pool surfaces. Fortunately, our ALL OUT ULTRA 4 IN 1, METAL OUT and STAIN OUT products allow you to solve this issue effectively and without having to worry."
