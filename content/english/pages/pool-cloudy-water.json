      "text": "Cloudy water can either be caused by unbalanced water, from a high level of organic waste in the water or from failure with your poolâ€™s water circulation system (clogged filter or insufficient filtration). Our SHOK and CLARITA products will help you quickly eliminate the appearance of cloudy water. However, be sure to identify and solve the problem at the source to prevent it from becoming a recurring problem! It is also important to make sure, before any treatment, that the parameters of your water are properly balanced."
