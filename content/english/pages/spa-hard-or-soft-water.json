      "text": "Hard water is water that naturally contains a lot of minerals such as limestone. Often, where you live determines the nature of the water: soft or hard. Excessively hard water can lead to limescale deposits in the spa and its plumbing, cloudy water and damage to the water circuits. On the other hand, water that is too soft is also problematic as it can cause foaming in your spa. React quickly! If the water is too hard, replace some of the water in your spa with fresh water. To solve water that is too soft, simply add SPA CALCIUM+ to your spa water."
