      "text": "You want to prevent your water from becoming cloudy? Don’t worry, all you have to do is regularly remove the organic waste at the source of this problem. Organic waste continually accumulates in your spa. Mainly, it comes from the people using the spa (sweat residues, creams or beauty products). Additionally, organic waste combines with free chlorine to form chloramine (combined chlorine). This phenomenon is responsible for the pronounced smell of chlorine, red eyes and irritated skin, as well as the irritation of the respiratory tract. Using one of Summer Smiles ® SPA SHOK ULTRA treatments will allow you to quickly dissolve even the finest particles of organic waste and chloramines in your spa water. Also, don’t forget good maintenance practices such as cleaning your spa and filter regularly to remove organic waste."
