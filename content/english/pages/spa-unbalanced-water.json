      "text": "Unbalanced spa water is caused by not maintaining the 3 main water parameters at the proper levels—pH, alkalinity and hardness. This issue must be resolved as quickly as possible. Unbalanced spa water can become corrosive and attack the spa’s mechanics which can cause scaling of your equipment. Our balancing products, SPA ALKA+, SPA ALKA-, SPA CALCIUM+ will help you to maintain the balance of your spa water for a pleasant and safe spa experience."
