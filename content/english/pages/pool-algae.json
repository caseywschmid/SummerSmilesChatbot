There are different colours of algae: green, yellow, pink or black algae. However, green and black algae are the ones most commonly found in swimming pools. Luckily, our ALG OUT 60% product effectively eliminates the presence of all types of algae and allows you to get back to that crystal-clear water we all enjoy so much!"
