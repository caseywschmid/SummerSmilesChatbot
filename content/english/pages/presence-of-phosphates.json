If so, it is possible that your water is contaminated by phosphates present in your environment. Over time, these phosphates can promote the growth of algae in the water. With our CLARITA ULTRA 3-in-1, PHOS OUT ULTRA 2-in-1 and ALL OUT ULTRA 4-in-1 products, Summer Smiles Â® has got you covered to get rid of phosphates, in addition to clarifying your water."
