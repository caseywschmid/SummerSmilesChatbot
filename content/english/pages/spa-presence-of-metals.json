      "text": "Corrosion of pipes, pumps, and other spa components is all part of the natural life cycle of your installation, but over time can contribute to the presence of dissolved metals in the water. Iron and copper are the most commonly found metals. Their presence in the water becomes a concern when they adhere to or stain the surfaces of your spa. Fortunately, our SPA STAIN OUT and SPA CLARITA products allow you to solve this issue effectively and without having to worry."
