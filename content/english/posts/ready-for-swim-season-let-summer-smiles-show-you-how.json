If you haven’t already begun, you can follow these steps for a successful pool opening ! 1- Remove the protective cover Clean and dry it thoroughly before storing to prevent damage. Remove any leaves or debris from the water. 2 – Inspect the pool equipment Check the condition of your filtration system, pump and accessories. Make sure no parts are damaged or worn after the winter. 3 – Connect the pipes Connect the pump to the filter. Connect the skimmer to pump, and the water return to the filter. If your pool is equipped with a heater, connect it to the water return. 4 – Fill the pool Raise water level above skimmer and do a light backwash. 5 – Clean the pool Vacuum the bottom of the pool to remove debris, then brush the sides to remove deposits and algae. Do a backwash. Raise the water level if necessary and make sure the filter position is set to filtration. 6 – Begin filtration Turn on the filter and check that all connections are tight. Allow the filtration system to run for 24 hours to remove accumulated impurities. 7 – Test the water Test your water using water test strips or visit a local retailer for advice . Adjust parameters as necessary using suitable products to achieve safe, balanced water. Test the alkalinity. The target range is 80-120 ppm. Wait 12 hours. Test the pH. The target range is 7.2-7.8. Wait 24 hours. Test the calcium hardness. The acceptable range is 200-300 ppm. Do not adjust if the water is cloudy.
