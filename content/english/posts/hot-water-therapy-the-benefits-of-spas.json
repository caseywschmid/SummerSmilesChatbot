    "text": "The benefits of hot water therapy have been known to people since ancient times. In fact, hot water therapy has been widely used in some countries as an effective form of rest and relaxation for thousands of years. The word spa means “health through water”. No wonder then that spas are growing in popularity here in Canada! When properly practiced – that is, without excess temperatures (extremely hot water is to be avoided) or prolonged immersion, hot water therapy offers many health benefits and is a highly effective way to relax. Hot water creates a sense of well-being and tranquillity as well as a feeling of lightness. Once submerged in water, the body weighs only a third of its weight. Dipping into a spa eases the pressure that’s normally exerted on the muscles and joints, thereby creating an immediate sense of comfort. Our movements also become slower and more ample. The combined effect of the soothing hot water and massaging water jets also improves blood circulation, eliminates excess lactic acid following physical exertion and helps the body to produce dopamines and endorphins – otherwise known as the “happy hormones”. Hot water therapy is therefore ideal for relaxing, relieving sore muscles and reducing stress, along with a host of other benefits that leave us feeling rejuvenated. What’s not to love? Some of the Benefits of Hot Water Therapy Improves blood circulation (lower blood pressure) Boosts metabolism Increases activity in the skin Eliminates toxins and other impurities Reduces inflammation in joints Softens collagen tissue, increasing its mobility Stimulates the production of endorphins (the hormone that fights pain) Relaxes muscles Improves range of motion Relieves aches and pains such as back pain, inflammation, rheumatism, etc. Boosts energy levels Lowers sugar levels Improves sleeping patterns Reduces stress and fatigue Stimulates the immune system Recommendations A poorly maintained spa can lead to the proliferation of bacteria, which can potentially increase the risk of infection.
