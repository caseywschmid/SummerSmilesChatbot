    "text": "Summer is in full swing. It’s hot and sunny, and pools are a getting a lot of use. Maintaining pool water isn’t always easy, so here are a few tips for keeping it clean and clear right into the fall. First, be sure to keep the water level in your pool high enough because water can evaporate quickly during hot weather. Second, check your chlorine levels often to keep algae growth at bay, because chlorine also evaporates quickly when it’s hot outside. Third, and most importantly, make sure your water has proper filtration and circulation! It is generally recommended that you leave your pool filter running at all times. Filtration is especially important during heat waves and when water temperature exceeds 27°C. The warmer the water, the faster bacteria and microorganisms will grow, which can imbalance water quality. In addition to filtration, you may also need to do some preventive disinfecting. Otherwise, bacteria and algae can proliferate. Since most microorganisms cannot grow in water below 10°C, you can greatly cut back on your doses of chemicals and all but stop filtration during cold weather and during the winter months. Filtering is most effective during the day, while algae are using sunlight to grow through photosynthesis. Filtration also helps to disperse sanitizers throughout the pool, which will further help to prevent microorganism growth. This is especially true during the summer months because photosynthesis increases with sunlight and heat. That being said, it’s a good idea to continue filtering your pool at night because some sanitizers are weakened by UV rays. However, few people adhere to this practice because they find the noise from their filters disruptive. To maximize the effectiveness of sanitizers, pool water needs proper circulation. When water isn’t being circulated, it becomes stagnant and creates an environment conducive to the growth of bacteria and algae. In fact, it’s estimated that poor circulation is responsible for nearly 90% of all pool water problems! Remember, filtration is most effective at night, when there are no bathers and no evaporation of chlorine due to UV rays. Then you have everything you need for a good disinfection. What is important is to have an ideal chlorine level at the beginning of the day. This is the ideal time for microorganism growth and it is then that we must act to prevent their appearance. It is important to leave the filtration on continuously, especially during the hot summer months! Off you go, then! Everybody into the pool!"
