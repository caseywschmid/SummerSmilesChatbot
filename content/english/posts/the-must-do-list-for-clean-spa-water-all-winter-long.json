    "text": "Learn how to extend the life and use of your spa Keeping your spa water clean throughout the winter is not only possible, it’s just as important as it is in the warmer months. Excess organic matter in your water can damage equipment and put a strain on the heating system, and if you live in an area where temperatures dip well below freezing, it’s also important to maintain good water circulation to prevent frozen pipes, and expensive repairs. Clean, balanced spa water prevents bacteria and algae growth and extends the life of your equipment by protecting it from scale buildup and corrosion . It also provides a more soothing and enjoyable spa experience at any time of the year. Want to get that winter spa experience? Here’s what you need to do : 1. Test the pH, alkalinity, hardness and sanitizer (chlorine or bromine) levels regularly. Cold water can slow the effectiveness of chemicals, so monitor your water closely and keep chemical levels balanced . 2. Clean the filter regularly to ensure efficient water circulation. For optimal filtration, clean as necessary and follow the manufacturer’s recommendations. 3. Use anti-foam and anti-scale products. These will help prevent residue build-up, especially if the spa is used frequently during the winter. 4. Run the filter for 10 to 12 hours every day , and make sure there is circulation at all times to prevent the water from freezing . 5. Check the water temperature regularly to ensure that the pumps are working properly. Even if you’re not using the spa, run the jets for a few minutes every day . 6. When your spa is not in use, a tight-fitting insulated cover that’s in good condition will retain heat and prevent ice build-up. 7. And if you don’t plan to use the spa frequently, consider draining it completely before winter to avoid potential problems caused by freezing. By keeping the water clean and properly balanced, you’ll be able to get the most out of your spa with family and friends, even after mercury dips. Want to learn more?
